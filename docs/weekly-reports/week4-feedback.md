## Comments :speech_balloon:
1) For linter setup, please find Canvas --> Week 5 --> Tuesday --> After Class for an example project. Feel free to use it as a reference. Please do note that the checkstyle configuration file is a bare minimum one. It satisfies the grading rubrics for letter grade B but will not satisfy A (which requires dadpting coding standard from Clean Code.)

2) Good effort in trying to setup spotbugs and checkstyle!

3) I can see in your week4.md planning already, but yes, "Finish Game Setup Phase" should be done soon :).
