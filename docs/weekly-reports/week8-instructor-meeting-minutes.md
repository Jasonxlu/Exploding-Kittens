## Agenda

### Progress Evaluation
1. Please delete .idea from the repository and change .gitignore to ignore the folder.
2. Spotbugs are only checking for 2 types of errors. Should check for all.
3. no UI code is found in the main branch :(
4. no card effect implementation is found in the main branch :(

### Questions from the team (about design, linter, tests, etc.)
1. BDD for drawing a card. branch name: 
2. UI class: making it a singleton is fine.
3. supporting 2 languages: 11/12's lecture
4. "single turn" is everything for this game indeed.
5. if mutation testing is failing, should go change BVA and then add test case and so on.

perhaps meeting a little more often
